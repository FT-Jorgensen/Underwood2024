```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
MacrosDraft<-read.csv("/Users/tjorgensen/Desktop/Underwood 2024/DATA - Macros.csv")
MacrosDraft$GraphCount<-rep(1,times=601)
ggplot(data=MacrosDraft,mapping=aes(x=Site,y=GraphCount,fill=Family)) + geom_bar(stat="identity",na.rm=TRUE) + scale_fill_hue()

```


```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
