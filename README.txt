Data README sheet


Data Sheet 1: Macros
TaxOrder, Genus Family- identified as narrowly as possible using Macroinvertebrates.org key (TaxOrder is named as such to avoid confusion with similarly named SQL command ‘Order’)
Length- length to the nearest millimeter
Weight- weight of macroinvertebrate in milligrams, identified from the length through published regression tables (Benke et al 1999, Cummins et al 2022)
Site- The river or portion of river from which the macroinvertebrate was collected
        J3: Restored section of Jabez Branch
        J1: Unrestored main branch of Jabez
        HB: Howard’s Branch
        AR: Arthur’s Run
        CC: Cattail Creek
        CU: Upper (unrestored) Cattail Creek
Restored- Y indicates site is restored, N indicates it is no
Habitat- Specific microhabitat of the Hess sampler site
        R: Cobble riffle
        L: Leaf/detritus pack
        V: Submerged aquatic vegetation
        U: Undercut bank
FFG- Instead of attempting to group them perfectly by phylogenetic relationship, oftentimes it is more useful to classify macroinvertebrates by what means they feed (and thus what role they play in the ecosystem). This is known as a “functional feeding group” or “FFG.”
        F: Filter-collector (individual has physiology or creates mechanism to trap and feed on 
nutrients in the water column coming towards it)
G: Gather-collector (individual moves around on riverbed or in water column searching 
for nutrients)
SH: Shredder (individual breaks down wood and other OM into smaller pieces to 
        consume)
SC: Scraper (individual consumes algae and nutrients off the side of larger material)
P: Predator (individual hunts and eats other macroinvertebrates)        


Data Sheet 2: SiteData
SiteName: Name of site, using the same nomenclature as other data sheet
LocNum: Specific number of area of site sample (1 is the most downstream, 3 is the most upstream)
Habitat: Microhabitat type, using same nomenclature as other data sheet
DO: Dissolved oxygen, measured in mg/L by YSI sampler
Temp: Temperature in degrees Celsius measured by YSI sampler
Conductivity: Water conductivity measured in S/cm by YSI sampler
PblCount: Average size of pebbles as measured using the Wolman pebble count
        First value length, second value width, third value depth
